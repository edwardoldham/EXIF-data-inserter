This script is custom tailored with the help of ChatGPT to address an issue created by capturing individual frames from 4K video created by my Potensic Atom 2 drone.\
\
Background\
I capture 4K video with my Potensic Atom 2 drone. I can also capture 12MP and 48MP images. As with any digital camera, the images captured automatically embed the appropriate EXIF data. My problem arose when I export individual video frames from a 4K video previously saved to disk. These individual frames are saved as 8.3MP tiff files but contain no EXIF data. I store these images in Google Photos and are stored in chronological order based on the original creation date stored in the EXIF data.\
\
The script is embedded within an Automator app designed to be \'93drag and drop\'94 and runs under Mac OS X. It will ask for the original creation date that you want to use but the rest of the EXIF data is inserted automatically.\
\
Note that this script can be easily modified to accommodate any digital device in use. It can also be changed to prompt the user to input various EXIF data that is currently automatically input by the script.\

My thanks to ChatGPT!}
